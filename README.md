# Omega Design Guidelines

For Omega, design is the basis of a user-friendly product or service. As the Omega project is open to everyone, the risk that Omega's graphic guidelines will be distorted is not insignificant. If it were to undergo deformations, the consistency of the project would no longer be felt by the user.

In order to avoid this kind of problem, this graphic charter has been created. Although you have no legal obligation to comply with it, we strongly recommend that you apply it firmly.
